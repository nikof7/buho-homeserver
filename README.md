# Home server

I want to learn Docker and docker-compose. And build a home server with the things i like and i find useful.

## Docker Containers
- Plex
- Owncloud or nextcloud or similar
- Samba is the same as OpenMediaVault?
- Transmission: torrent manager
- Radarr or Flexget: Management and automation of movies downlading
- Homarr: Landing page of the server
- WireGuard: VPN
- Nginx: What is it? It is useful?
